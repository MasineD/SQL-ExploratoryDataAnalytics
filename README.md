## How to run the SQL code

	1.Download the SQL-ExploratoryDataAnalytics zip folder on Github to your device
	2.Unzip the downloaded folder
	3.Open SQL Server Management Studio
	4.Navigate to the 'File' tab and select 'Open Folder'
	5.Select the unzipped folder
	6.Execute the query in CreateDB.sql file
	7.Execute the queries in LoadData.sql file
	8.Execute the queries in ExploreData.sql, SectionB.sql, SectionC.sql, SectionD.sql in the order they are written
